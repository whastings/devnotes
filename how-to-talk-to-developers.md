"It's more important to be entertaining than informative"
- Do weird and unexpected things to keep people's attention

Always start with your main thesis, then get more specific as you go along
- That way, if someone has to leave halfway through, they've already got the main point

"Show, don't tell"
- e.g. live coding demos
- Better than slides
- Provides way more info in a better manner than telling

Body language
- Stand tall and confident, though comfortable
- Keep hands out in front of you, arms bent

People like stories
- Even stories they know if they're delivered in a captivating manner
- Especially about you and embarrassing

Dealing with nerves
- Nerves are innevitable
- If you act like you're confident and having fun, your brain will follow along
- Watch for your nodder (the person who nods at all you're saying)

Asking for questions
- Say "let's have some questions"
- Put hands behind back for a *listening pose*
- Move towards the person asking the question

Antipatterns
- Not being excited and passionate
- Not knowing if people can read your slides in the back
- Pre-appologizing (sets a low expectation)

If you're a beginner:s
- Ask for a smaller room.
- Ask to go early in the conference/day
