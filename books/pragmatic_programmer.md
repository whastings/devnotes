# The Pragmatic Programmer - Notes

## Introduction

* Use pragmatism to choose the best technology and implementation for each individual situation
* "In order to be a Pragmatic Programmer, we're challenging you to think about what you're doing
  while you're doing it. This isn't a one-time audit of current practicesâ€”it's an ongoing critical
  appraisal of every decision you make, every day, and on every development. Never run on
  auto-pilot."

## Ch. 1: A Pragmatic Philosophy

* Take responsibility for your work
  * Keep an eye out for risks that are beyond your control
  * If something goes wrong, provide options for what to do next rather than excuses
* Don't leave "broken windows"
  * e.g. Bad designs, wrong decisions, poor code
  * If these things are left around, it encourages a team culture of tolerating such things and
    producing similar inferior work
* Push for change wisely
  * Don't ask for too much up front
  * Instead, ask for something small, show everyone how it makes things better, then ask for a
    little more
* Keep the big picture in mind
  * Pay attention to more than what you're doing
  * You need to notice if the project starts getting into a bad state
* Write **good enough software**
  * Your code must be good enough for your users and coworkers but without taking too much time,
    effort, etc. to produce
  * Involve users/stakeholders in the decision of the scope and quality necessary for the system
    you're building
    * Discuss it along with other requirements
    * Many would rather have something sooner than wait for perfection
  * Often, getting feedback sooner by getting your work out there sooner is better overall
  * "Don't spoil a perfectly good program by overembellishment and over-refinement. Move on, and let
    your code stand in its own right for a while."
* Invest in your knowledge and experience
  * Remember your existing knowledge and experience will eventually fall out-of-date
  * Diversify by learning different technologies, problem domains, etc.
    * This will make you more resilient to change
  * Look for new technologies that may pay off big if you learn them early
  * Learn new programming languages frequently
    * Languages approach problems differently, so learning more will broaden your thinking
    * Even if you don't use them, you'll be expanding your thinking
* Work on your communication
  * Work out what it is you want to say and refine your writing until it gets the points across
  * Understand your audience so you can best communicate with them
    * Their needs, interests, capabilities
    * Pick a good time, use an appropriate style (e.g. casual, formal)
    * Make your written ideas look good
