# Interviewing - Notes

## Preparing

* Practice answering question on a white board

## Tips

* Be enthusiastic
  * Especially about the company's mission
  * And make sure the interviewers can tell you're enthusiastic
  * Take notes before the interview on what you find exciting about the company
    * Then bring these things up during the interviews
* Follow a standard problem-solving process:
  * Ask clarifying questions
    * Use the time to collect your thoughts
    * Ask about edge cases, the expected output, example inputs
  * Talk through a brute-force solution
    * Remember, talking is more engaging for the interviewer
    * Ask the interviewer if they'd like you to implement it or move on to a more optimized solution
  * Talk through an optimized solution
    * Use your interviewer as a sounding board for ideas
    * Discuss similar problems you've encountered
    * Write code once you and the interviewer agree you have a good solution
  * Then write the code
* Prep for web backend architecture design questions
  * Know about HTTP, databases, CDNS, caching, load balancers
  * Know how they fit together to form systems
  * Move from high level details to lower level details
    * Along the way, ask the interviewer for more specification details
  * Focus on and discuss tradeoffs in your design
* Talk about real projects with real results
  * Highlight the results to the interviewer
  * Don't focus too much on interesting tech
* Prefer dynamic languages when answering interview questions
  * But mention work you've done in other languages
* Mention if you already have other offers on the table
  * Consider interviewing at companies in reverse order of interest

## Algorithm & Data Structure Interviews

* Companies ask them to test how you solve hard problems that require you to keep lots of details
  in your head at once
  * In real life, you do this in large, weeks long projects that have many parts
    * But interviews don't have time for this and so use short, easy-to-describe, but difficult
      problems
* You need to know the classic, core algorithms and data structures that companies test for
  * Data structures:
    * Ones to know:
      * Arrays
      * Linked Lists
      * Hash Maps
      * Binary Search Trees
      * Heaps
    * Know how to implement the essential operations (e.g. add, remove, contains)
      * And the Big O performance of each
    * Know how to write code that utilizes the data structures
  * Algorithms:
    * Ones to know:
      * Breadth First Search
      * Depth First Search
      * Dijkstra's Algorithm
      * Merge Sort
      * Quick Sort
      * Binary Search
    * Know the Big O performance of each
* Techniques to learn:
  * Dynamic Programming
  * Recursion
  * Composing data structures
* Resources:
  * *Algorithm Design Manual* by Skiena
    * Particularly chapters 3 - 5
  * Cracking the Coding Interview
