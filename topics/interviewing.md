# Interviewing - Notes

## Algorithm & Data Structure Interviews

* Companies ask them to test how you solve hard problems that require you to keep lots of details
  in your head at once
  * In real life, you do this in large, weeks long projects that have many parts
    * But interviews don't have time for this and so use short, easy-to-describe, but difficult
      problems
* You need to know the classic, core algorithms and data structures that companies test for
  * Data structures:
    * Ones to know:
      * Arrays
      * Linked Lists
      * Hash Maps
      * Binary Search Trees
      * Heaps
    * Know how to implement the essential operations (e.g. add, remove, contains)
      * And the Big O performance of each
    * Know how to write code that utilizes the data structures
  * Algorithms:
    * Ones to know:
      * Breadth First Search
      * Depth First Search
      * Dijkstra's Algorithm
      * Merge Sort
      * Quick Sort
      * Binary Search
    * Know the Big O performance of each
* Techniques to learn:
  * Dynamic Programming
  * Recursion
  * Composing data structures
* Resources:
  * *Algorithm Design Manual* by Skiena
  * Cracking the Coding Interview
