# React Native Notes

## Lists

- Use `ScrollView` for small lists
  - As it renders all items at once
- Use `FlatList` for long lists
  - As it efficiently renders only items on screen

## Styling

### Flexbox

* No need to `display: flex`
  * Just set flex properties on elements
* Default flex direction is column

## Debugging

* Opening Developer Menu
  * In Android emulator: Cmd + M

## Local Development

### Networking

- On iOS simulator, can use `localhost`
- On Android emulator, must use `10.0.2.2`
