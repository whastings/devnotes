# Accessibility Notes

## Focus Management

* When programmatically moving focus, ensure that:
  * The element receiving focus has `tabindex="-1"` and has content for screen reader to read
  * Focus isn't moving unexpectedly (ideally, only move it as result of user interaction)
  * JS and the browser have had enough time to render any dynamically loaded content
    * e.g. Call `.focus()` in a `setTimeout`

## Live Regions

* Can be `assertive` or `polite`
  * `assertive` will cause screen reader to interrupt what it's currently reading
* Can use `role="alert"` on a container to make it an assertive live region labeled as an alert
* Must exist in DOM and be empty *before* content is added
  * Can't insert one and make announcement all at once
  * Ideally, just add empty one on page load
* Try to keep content short
* Should remove content from live region shortly after it's added
  * Don't want user to run across content that's no longer relevant
* Can be visually hidden if not helpful for visual users
