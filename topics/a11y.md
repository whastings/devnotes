# Accessibility Notes

## Focus Management

* When programmatically moving focus, ensure that:
  * The element receiving focus has `tabindex="-1"` and has content for screen reader to read
  * Focus isn't moving unexpectedly (ideally, only move it as result of user interaction)
  * JS and the browser have had enough time to render any dynamically loaded content
    * e.g. Call `.focus()` in a `setTimeout`
    * Use 1 second delay to support the buggiest screen readers
* For new SPA page, move focus to heading that titles the page

## Live Regions

* Can be `assertive` or `polite`
  * `assertive` will cause screen reader to interrupt what it's currently reading
  * Use assertive for the result of a user interaction
* Can use `role="alert"` on a container to make it an assertive live region labeled as an alert
* Must exist in DOM and be empty *before* content is added
  * Can't insert one and make announcement all at once
  * Ideally, just add empty one on page load
* Try to keep content short
* Should remove content from live region shortly after it's added
  * Don't want user to run across content that's no longer relevant
* Can be visually hidden if not helpful for visual users
* Can use to let user know a long running operation is in progress
* Can use to announce that an operation succeeded or failed

## Forms

* Better not to use placeholder as input label
  * Not displayed with sufficiently high contrast
  * Intended for non-essential info
  * Some screen readers only read it when input is empty
* Better to associate label to input with for/id instead of nesting
* Can use `aria-label` when no visual label needed
  * e.g. Input with search button next to it
* `aria-labelledby` can refer to multiple elements via space-separated IDs
  * e.g. To associate an input in a table with row and column labels
* For a multi-input field (e.g. phone number) you can use `<label>` for first input and `aria-label` or off screen label for rest
* Use `aria-describedby` to associate an input with additional instructions
  * Instructions must not be inside form without association
* Required fields
  * Set `aria-required="true"`
    * Or `required` if you want browser validation too
  * Also provide visual marker (e.g. asterisks)
* Form errors
  * Fields with errors should have `aria-invalid="true"`
  * If each error message displayed next to field, associate field with `aria-describedby`
  * If all errors displayed at top of form, send focus to them after submit
  * If errors displayed inline, send focus to brief summary above form or to first invalid field
  * If form does page (re)load, put brief message in page `<title>`
  * For screen readers, it's better to wait until the form is submitted to display errors than to try real time validation
* Anti-patterns
  * Automatically moving focus to next input

## Screen Readers

* Have different modes for different types of tasks
  * e.g. Reading a document, filling out a form, navigating a table
  * Focus mode = Only navigate through focusable elements
  * Application mode = Most keyboard shortcuts disabled so app can implement custom ones
    * Activated with `role="application"`
* Important shortcuts
  * VoiceOver
    * Open rotor: Control + Option + U
    * Next heading: Control + Option + Command + H
  * NVDA
    * Open elements list: Insert + F7
    * Next heading: H

## Manual Testing

* Ensure all controls a mouse can interact with:
  * Can be reached via tab key
  * Show a focus indicator when focused
  * Can be activated or modified with the keyboard (e.g. space to check a checkbox)
  * Are in a logical tab order
* Ensure that dynamic content changes move keyboard focus appropriately
  * e.g. Closing a modal should return focus to trigger
  * e.g. Moving focus to newly-inserted content
* Ensure no info is communicated solely with color
  * Can use color if itâ€™s supplemented by text
* Ensure all form inputs have associated labels
  * Should be visible and visually close to input
  * Should be marked up so screen readers will read them
* Ensure form inputs that should be grouped are grouped
  * Grouped in `<fieldset>` with `<legend>`
  * e.g. All the radio inputs for a single question
* Ensure form inputs w/ additional instructions besides label have instructions read by screen reader when focused
* Ensure when form is submitted
  * Success message is properly-focused if form submitted successfully
  * If submission failed, error summary is focused and each individual error message is associated w/ its input

## Images

* Alt text should be brief, about 200 - 300 characters
* If image needs longer description:
  * You can associate it to content on the page using `aria-describedby`
  * You can put details in a collapsed region or modal
  * You can provide URL of description to screen readers via `longdesc` attribute
* For non-decorative inline SVG:
  * Add `role="img"`
  * Add a `<title>` as first child with alternate text
    * For best support, link the `<title>` to the `<svg>` with `aria-labelledby`
  * Any text that should be read should be included in `aria-labelledby`
* For non-decorative font icon:
  * Add `role="img"`
  * Alternative text via `aria-label`
  * If in button or link, add `aria-label` to button/link and make icon `aria-hidden="true"`

## Document Structure & Markup

* Page `<title>`
  * Use to describe page purpose to screen readers
  * Should change when URL changes (even for SPA)
  * Ideally is unique for each page
  * Should display unique portion before repeated portion (e.g. business name)
* Language specification
  * Add primary page language to `<html>` with `lang` attribute
  * If language changes for any part of page, add `lang` to part's container
* Landmarks
  * If multiple instances of same type, give unique name with `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`
* Headings
  * Ideally, have one `<h1>` on the page at the beginning of the main content
    * With no headings before it
    * Helps screen readers jump to main content
* Links
  * Should not be used as buttons, as screen reader users expect them to go somewhere
  * Should have descriptive text (not just "click here")
  * If opens a new tab, should indicate that it does so
  * If links to a file, should indicate file type
  * Should be visually distinguishable from surrounding text
    * Ideally with more than just color
    * But if just color, then with sufficient contrast with surrounding text
* Skip nav links
  * Should be first focusable element on page
  * Should be visible when focused
* Don't use `tabindex` > 0
* Tables
  * Screen readers navigate it like a spreadsheet
  * Screen readers read header and content for each cell
  * Use a `<caption>` to give table an accessible name
  * Place header row in `<thead>`
  * Place body rows in `<tbody>`
  * Place header text in `<th>`
  * When you have column and row headers, use `<th scope="col">` for column and `<th scope="row">` for row
  * If you must use a table for layout, give it `role="presentation"`
* iframes
  * Screen readers treat their content mostly as if it's part of the overall page
  * Can give it a title with `title` attribute
* Duplicate IDs on a page can cause lots of problems for screen reader users
  * Might read wrong element
