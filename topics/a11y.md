# Accessibility Notes

## Focus Management

* When programmatically moving focus, ensure that:
  * The element receiving focus has `tabindex="-1"` and has content for screen reader to read
  * Focus isn't moving unexpectedly (ideally, only move it as result of user interaction)
  * JS and the browser have had enough time to render any dynamically loaded content
    * e.g. Call `.focus()` in a `setTimeout`
    * Use 1 second delay to support the buggiest screen readers
* For new SPA page, move focus to heading that titles the page

## Live Regions

* Can be `assertive` or `polite`
  * `assertive` will cause screen reader to interrupt what it's currently reading
  * Use assertive for the result of a user interaction
* Can use `role="alert"` on a container to make it an assertive live region labeled as an alert
* Must exist in DOM and be empty *before* content is added
  * Can't insert one and make announcement all at once
  * Ideally, just add empty one on page load
* Try to keep content short
* Should remove content from live region shortly after it's added
  * Don't want user to run across content that's no longer relevant
* Can be visually hidden if not helpful for visual users
* Can use to let user know a long running operation is in progress
* Can use to announce that an operation succeeded or failed

## Forms

* Better not to use placeholder as input label
  * Not displayed with sufficiently high contrast
  * Intended for non-essential info
